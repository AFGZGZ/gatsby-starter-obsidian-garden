## Introduction

A Gatsby starter template to publish [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault for free, created by [@juxtdesigncc](https:/juxtdesign.cc/?utm_source=obsidian-garden)

## Key Features

Obsidian currently offers Publish services ($20/month) with advance features. This starter is a free alternative for Obsidian users who want to publish their digital garden as a website. Obsidian can also serve as an on-device CMS to manage your content. (Cross-platform synchronization is also possible via Obsidian Sync / [Git](https://desktopofsamuel.com/how-to-sync-obsidian-vault-for-free-using-git/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_id=starter-obsidian))

<Features />

<!-- - Publish your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) knowledge base as a website for free using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/)
- Support YAML (e.g. tags, publish) that are also supported by Obsidian -->

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Create a Gatsby site.

Clone this template and navigate into the folder

```
git clone https://github.com/juxtdesigncc/gatsby-starter-obsidian-garden project-name
cd project-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies.

Install dependencies using yarn or npm

`yarn install` or `npm install`

### 3. Open the code and start customizing!

Running `gatsby develop` or `yarn run develop` to start the site

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

## üíª Setup

**Read before you use your own Obsidian vault or create a new one**

Whether you wish to use your existing Obsidian vault or start a new vault, the following Obsidian preferences has to be set up correctly. Starting a new vault is highly recommended as these options are not on by default. All existing notes using the `[[Wikilinks]]` will need to update manually. Here're a list of preferences:

- Settings - Files & Links: Use [[Wikilinks]] option should be OFF. It will change the link format from `[[Wikilinks]]` to `[MarkdownLink]`.
- Settings - Default location for new attachments: Should be set as 'In a folder specificed below' and create a folder named `media`, remember to update the config in `gatsby-source-filesystem` in `gatsby-config.js` if the media folder has changed.
- By default, all notes will be published , but add frontmatter `publish: false` to hide a note.

Current example vault in `/content/vault` has already implemented all the aforementioned preference settings

### Why `gatsby-remark-relative-images` need to be not the latest version?
